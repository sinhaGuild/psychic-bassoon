## All AI Conversations under One Roof.

Assistant AIs are the future and OpenAI revolutionized this movement with ChatGPT. While numerous methods exist to integrate them, this app commemorates the original styling of ChatGPT, with the ability to integrate any current/future AI models, while improving upon original client features, such as conversation search and prompt templates (currently WIP).

This project was started early in Feb '23, anticipating the release of the official ChatGPT API from OpenAI, and now uses it. Through this clone, you can avoid ChatGPT Plus in favor of free or pay-per-call APIs. I will soon deploy a demo of this app. Feel free to contribute, clone, or fork. Currently dockerized.
